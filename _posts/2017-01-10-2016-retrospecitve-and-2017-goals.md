2016 was a pretty good year. I transitioned away from an earlier stage of work life where I thought economics research was all I wanted to be doing. As it turns out, seeing how the research sausage gets made can be just as ugly as seeing how any other sausage gets made. After 18 months as a research assistant, I took a new job with more of a software development bent. For 2016 and again for 2017, I've tried picking out a few areas that I want to focus on in my reading, side projects, etc. Otherwise, I end up with way too much breadth and not enough depth. I'm probably still too far on the breadth side, but hey, there is always 2018...
