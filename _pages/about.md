# Me
Since June 2017, my wife and I have lived in Philadelphia, PA. I am currently a Data Scientist on the R&D team at [Blackfynn](https://www.blackfynn.com/) where I have worked on a variety of projects involving three interrelated efforts: developing data integration tools, understanding disease progression, and leveraging data-driven methods to improve trial efficiency.

Previously, I was a Scientific Software Engineer at the [Computational Memory Lab](https://www.blackfynn.com/) at the University of Pennsylvania where I worked on the [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/about-darpa/)-funded [Restoring Active Memory](https://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory) (RAM) project. The goal of the RAM project was to develop an implantable memory-enhancing device for individuals with traumatic brain injuries. Prior to that, I worked at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a Python Developer and Associate Economist respectively. 

It’s probably clear from the section above, but I have a dual passion for software engineering and applied statistics. At the end of the day, I’m most excited by professional and educational opportunities that give me opportunity to grow along both these dimensions. Towards that end, I am currently pursuing a masters degree in Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania on a part-time basis (one course per semester). As a life-long learner it is also important to me to share what I learn with others. In my professional life, this means giving lunch-and-learn style presentations (although they’ve gone by different names at each place I’ve worked) on topics that are of interest to me, that I’ve learned through coursework, or that I’ve picked up out of necessity for a project.

On a personal level, I love to make food and drinks (pour-over coffee, espresso, and cocktails).  I am also passionate about sports (doing them, not so much watching). I was a competitive gymnast for 10 years, dove for a year in high school, and then played ultimate frisbee all through college and for a bit afterwards. I’ve transitioned to jogging and bodyweight exercises to avoid what seemed to be a constant stream of injuries. Most importantly, I’m lucky enough to be married to an incredible woman who supports me in innumerable ways and puts up with this web of costly hobbies.

# Blog

The title of the blog is a reference to [_The Pragmatic Programmer_](https://pragprog.com/book/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition); one of my favorite books about software development. This blog is primarily self-serving, but hopefully with a healthy dose of interesting information for lost visitors and some self-deprecating humor thrown in. It is not intended to be one of those obligatory personal websites that is an unspoken requirement for landing a solid tech job. Call me crazy, but I prefer a little personality behind a blog.
This started as a way to get some sort of basic familiarity with web programming and resulted in a back-log of markdown files on an array of topics. In general, posts will be one of the following:

1. Resources
2. Tutorials
3. Miscellaneous commentary
