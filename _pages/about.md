# Me
Professionally, I work as a developer writing code mostly in Python. 
I recently started a masters degree in computer science at the 
University of Chicago on a part time basis.

Personally, I have a set of somewhat stereotypical hobbies/interests including 
craft coffee and cocktails, cooking awesome food, and playing ultimate frisbee. 
I'm also lucky enough to be married to an incredible woman who puts up with 
this web of costly and arguably pretentious hobbies.

# Blog
This blog should really be called "Novice to Pseudo-Journeyman", but the actual 
title rolls off the tongue  and is a reference to one of my [favorite 
books about programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer). 
This blog is primarily self-serving, but hopefully with a healthy dose of useful 
information for lost visitors and self-deprecating humor thrown in. It is not 
intended to be one of those obiligatory personal websites that is an unspoken 
requirement for landing a solid tech job. Call me crazy, but I prefer a little 
personality behind a blog. 

This started as a way for me get some sort of basic familiarity with web 
programming and resulted in a back-log of markdown files in outline form on an 
array of topics both (I hope) generally relevant and totally trivial/personal. 
In general, posts will be one of the following: 

1. Collections of resources
2. Quick-hacks and Gotchas (code snippets)
3. Commentary on developing coding skills
4. Miscellaneous personal commentary
