A few weeks ago, I completed a graduate-level Bayesian Statistics course at Penn ([STAT-927](https://apps.wharton.upenn.edu/syllabi/2020A/STAT927001/)). Although I have been interested in Bayesian Statistics for quite a while now (both in an [abstract sense](https://zduey.github.io/miscellaneous/bayesian-statistics-critical-thinking-part1/) and an applied one), this was the first formal course I have taken. Professionally, I developed some Bayesian multilevel regression models during my time at the [Computational Memory Lab](https://zduey.github.io/miscellaneous/bayesian-statistics-critical-thinking-part1/) as part of the [RAM project](https://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory). However, in my current position, I have not typically leveraged fully Bayesian approaches.

Last week at work, I gave an overview of Bayesian Statistics during a lunch-and-learn style session. The intention was to have the material be accessible to anyone with some background in probability and at least a high-level understanding of classical statistics (e.g. at least some familiarity with p-values, hypothesis testing, and confidence intervals). The structure of the presentation largely follows the outline from the first couple of lectures from the course (albeit at a slightly higher level), but with the addition of a running example.

I had a lot of fun putting the slides together and wrestling with how to present the material to a mixed audience (data curators, data scientists, and software engineers). As putting a presentation together often does, it solidified my understanding in many places and pointed to some areas where it is still lacking. Iâ€™m hoping to delve into some additional techniques from the course in a future presentation (probably geared towards a smaller audience). In the meantime, here are the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B-_2ApMT1vVwZ_N17jVLvDwhuG4sbAdiXX9taQh0jEQ/edit?usp=sharing) and [code](https://github.com/zduey/intro-bayes-stat-presentation) from the initial presentation.
