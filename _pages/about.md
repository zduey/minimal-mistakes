# Me
In June 2017, my wife and I moved from Chicago to Philadelphia for her to start a PhD program.
As part of that move, I started a new position as a Scientific Software Engineer at the 
[Computational Memory Lab](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page) at the University of Pennsylvania. 
I currently support the [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil/about-us/about-darpa)-funded [RAM](https://www.darpa.mil/program/restoring-active-memory) 
(Restoring Active Memory) project, which aims to develop an implantable memory-enhancing device
for patients with traumatic brain injuries. Previously, I have worked at the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago as a Python Developer and Associate Economist respectively.

Personally, I have a set of somewhat stereotypical hobbies/interests including 
coffee, cocktails, cooking, and (less now that I keep getting hurt) playing ultimate frisbee. 
I'm also lucky enough to be married to an incredible woman who puts up with 
this web of costly and arguably pretentious hobbies.

# Blog
This blog should really be called "Novice to Pseudo-Journeyman", but the actual 
title rolls off the tongue  and is a reference to one of my [favorite 
books about programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pragmatic_Programmer). 
This blog is primarily self-serving, but hopefully with a healthy dose of useful 
information for lost visitors and self-deprecating humor thrown in. It is not 
intended to be one of those obligatory personal websites that is an unspoken 
requirement for landing a solid tech job. Call me crazy, but I prefer a little 
personality behind a blog. 

This started as a way for me get some sort of basic familiarity with web 
programming and resulted in a back-log of markdown files in outline form on an 
array of topics both (I hope) generally relevant and totally trivial/personal. 
In general, posts will be one of the following: 

1. Collections of resources
2. Quick-hacks and Gotchas (code snippets)
3. Commentary on developing coding skills
4. Miscellaneous personal commentary
